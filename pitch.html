      <p class="log-line">Farmworking communities in the Central Valley battle the ongoing California drought - in the fields and at home.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> As California’s water crisis looms over the agricultural industry, the news coverage has focused on the threat to big growers while often  overlooking the devastating potential impact to the laborers and small migrant communities.
      </p>

      <p>Agricultural laborers face not only work shortages but the increased potential of contaminated water supplies, which threatens both their health and their economic stability as a disproportionate amount of their budgets is spent on private water supplies and other basic needs.
      </p>

      <p>I visited several farmworking communities in the Central Valley and San Joaquin Valley, including a trip to Huron, a town of fewer than 7,000 residents in Fresno County, to closely examine how the drought threatens the vital but easily forgotten laborers of California's agricultural industry.
      </p>


      <p>"People are jobless as a result as not having water available," City of Fresno's Director of Public Utlities Thomas Esqueda said, echoing the concerns of leading academics, agricultural industry professionals, and other public officials on the front lines of the crisis.
      </p>

        <p>With <em>No Hay Agua</em>, I hope to communicate the immense impact of California's water crisis from a wide variety of perspectives and voices, through documentary video, data visualization, and on-the-ground reporting.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Exploration of current data visualization options regarding well water contamination locations and farming acreage that has fallowed in the Central Valley is currently ongoing.
