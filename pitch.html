      <p><strong>Log line:</strong> Farmworking communities in the Central Valley battle the ongoing California drought - in the fields and at home
      </p>


      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> California’s drought has consistently worried farms across the state, especially because California produces about 50 percent of the nation’s agriculture. While most news coverage regarding this intersection between the drought and agriculture focuses on drying fields and what this means for growers, possible water restriction mandates, or potential economic setbacks for the industry, how the drought affects the labor side of the industry more specifically is frequently overlooked.
      </p>

      <p>Rising job insecurity has surfaced as one of the more predominant challenges faced by farmworkers because of fallowing fields, but the contaminated water supply in the Valley may forbid some communities from even having easy access to a clean glass of water.
      </p>


      <p>By engaging with the community of Huron in Fresno County, with a population of just over 6,500 people, <strong>No Hay Agua</strong> engages with community voices and as a lens into this larger issue of how the California drought has affected a more intimate aspect of the agricultural industry.
