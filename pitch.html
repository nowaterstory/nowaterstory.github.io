      <p class="log-line">Farmworking communities in the Central Valley battle the ongoing California drought - in the fields and at home
      </p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> As California’s water crisis looms, most news coverage has focused solely on what the threat of the drought will be for big growers in the agrilcultural industry at large, but its affect on the laborers and small migrant communities is frequently overlooked. 
      </p>

      <p>Not only do laborers face rising job insecurity, but the dangers of an increasingly contaminated water supply, creates even more economic pressure in addition to the obvious health risks. 
      </p>

      <p>So I visited several farmworking communities in the Central Valley and San Joaquin Valley. My visits inlcuded a trip to Huron in Fresno county-a small community of under 7,000 people-which allowed me to hone in on a more intimate aspect of the threat the drought poses to the agricltural industry.  
      </p>

      <p><strong>No Hay Agua</strong> shows the immense impact of the water crisis from a wide variety of perspectives. From leading academics to agricultural industry professionals to public officials on the front lines of the crisis, the list includes UC Berkeley and Loma Linda University professors, activist voices from California Rural Legal Assistance and the Community Water Center. 
      </p>

      <p>"People are jobless as a result as not having water available," City of Fresno's Director of Public Utlities Thomas Esqueda said. 
      </p>

      <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Exploration of current data visualization options regarding well water contamination locations and farming acreage that has fallowed in the Central Valley is currently ongoing.
