      <p class="log-line">Farmworking communities in the Central Valley battle the ongoing California drought - in the fields and at home
      </p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> California’s drought has consistently worried farms across the state, especially because California produces about 50 percent of the nation’s agriculture. While most news coverage regarding this intersection between the drought and agriculture focuses on drying fields and what this means for growers, possible water restriction mandates, or potential economic setbacks for the industry, how the drought affects the labor side of the industry more specifically is frequently overlooked.
      </p>

      <p>Rising job insecurity has surfaced as one of the more predominant challenges faced by farmworkers because of fallowing fields, but the contaminated water supply in the Valley may forbid some communities from even having easy access to a clean glass of water.
      </p>

      <p>By engaging with the community of Huron in Fresno County, with a population of just over 6,500 people, <strong>No Hay Agua</strong> engages with community voices and as a lens into this larger issue of how the California drought has affected a more intimate aspect of the agricultural industry.
      </p>

      <p>Having conducted over twenty interviews from academics and industry professionals including UC Berkeley and Loma Linda University professors, activist voices from California Rural Legal Assistance and Community Water Center, and public officials such as Fresno’s Director of Public Utilities Thomas Esqueda, <strong>No Hay Agua</strong> shows the immense impact of the water crisis from various perspectives.
      </p>

      <p>"A number of individuals have indicated no farming this year and means that's no pruning, no picking, no cultivation," Esqueda said. "So people are jobless as a result as not having water available."
      </p>

      <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Exploration of current data visualization options regarding well water contamination locations and farming acreage that has fallowed in the Central Valley is currently ongoing.
